Research Assistant AI Agent
# FN_CodieMunos_ITAI2376
My name is Codie Munos and I am in ITAI 2376.
I am using Google Collab to create a research assistant that can satisfy the following:
Input Processing: How the agent interprets user requests or environmental data
Memory System: How the agent stores and retrieves information
Reasoning Component: How the agent makes decisions and plans actions
Output Generation: How the agent communicates results or takes actions

The setup of Google Collab was familiar and I had to do a bit of research to pick where I wanted to go with this assignment.
I created a new notebook, then started to layout the foundation of my project. I decided to use Kaggle and Gemini's AI assistant for my externam sources. 
I set up my collab notebook to be integrated with my GitHub repository.
